# Storage

RMK's storage system provides persistent flash memory for storing data like keyboard configurations and BLE bonding information.

## Storage Feature

RMK's storage system is enabled by the `storage` feature, which is part of the default feature set. Enabling BLE automatically pulls in `storage`, since BLE bonding data must be persisted to non-volatile storage. The host configurator protocols (`rynk` and `vial`) rely on `storage` to persist keymap edits across reboots but do not enable it themselves, so keep it enabled when you use them.

## Storage Configuration

By default, RMK saves data to your microcontroller's internal flash memory.

- For users configuring with `keyboard.toml`, the default storage space details are located in the `rmk-config/src/default_config` folder. If your microcontroller's configuration isn't found there, RMK uses the **last `num_sectors` flash sectors** of your microcontroller's internal flash memory. `num_sectors` defaults to 8 when a `[dfu]` section is present, either in your `keyboard.toml` or in the chip default (nRF52840, nice!nano, RP2040 and Pico W ship one), otherwise 2. On nRF BLE builds without DFU, the default start address `0` means `0x60000` instead of the end of flash. See [Storage configuration](../configuration/storage) for all `[storage]` fields.

- For Rust API users, create a `StorageConfig` struct and pass it to `initialize_keymap_and_storage`, which sets up the storage from your flash peripheral. Besides `start_addr` and `num_sectors`, `StorageConfig` carries `clear_storage` and `clear_layout`, which erase everything or only the layout at boot:

```rust
use rmk::config::{BehaviorConfig, PositionalConfig, StorageConfig};
use rmk::{KeymapData, initialize_keymap_and_storage};

let storage_config = StorageConfig::default();
let mut behavior_config = BehaviorConfig::default();
let per_key_config = PositionalConfig::default();
let mut keymap_data = KeymapData::new(keymap::get_default_keymap());
let (keymap, mut storage) = initialize_keymap_and_storage(
    &mut keymap_data,
    flash,
    &storage_config,
    &mut behavior_config,
    &per_key_config,
)
.await;

// `storage` is a runnable — pass it to `run_all!` with everything else
run_all!(matrix, storage, usb_transport, keyboard).await;
```

::: warning
Ensure you allocate sufficient storage space for your keymap and bonding information. 32 KiB is generally adequate for most keyboards.

## Storage Is Cleared When RMK Is Rebuilt

The firmware embeds a build hash computed by the `rmk` crate's build script from the git commit and build time. The hash is written to storage when storage is first initialized, and checked on every boot: if the stored hash doesn't match the running firmware's hash, RMK erases the storage and re-initializes it from the firmware's defaults.

The hash only changes when the `rmk` build script re-runs: after `cargo clean`, or when you change the `rmk` version, its Cargo features, or the build profile. Rebuilding your own crate — for example after editing the keymap or `keyboard.toml` — reuses the same hash, so the stored keymap, keymap edits made via Vial/Rynk and BLE bonds survive that flash, and your keymap edits in source do **not** replace the stored keymap. To force a reset in that case, set `clear_layout = true` (keymap only) or `clear_storage = true` (everything, including BLE bonds) in the `[storage]` section of `keyboard.toml`, or the same fields of `StorageConfig`, flash once, then set them back to `false`.

When the hash does change, the stored keymap, behavior settings and layout are cleared and rebuilt from the firmware's defaults. BLE bonds, the active profile and the split peer address are carried over (`keep_bonds`, default `true`), so a firmware update does not need the hosts to be paired again; they are lost only with `clear_storage = true`, or with `keep_bonds = false`, which restores the old behaviour of clearing everything.
